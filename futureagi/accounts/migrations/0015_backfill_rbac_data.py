"""
Data migration: backfill RBAC data for existing users.

Combines all backfill operations in dependency order:
1. Create OrganizationMembership rows for users with user.organization set.
2. Backfill integer levels from legacy string roles on OrganizationMembership.
3. Backfill integer levels from legacy string roles on WorkspaceMembership.
4. Link WorkspaceMembership → OrganizationMembership where missing.
5. Enable workspaces for all existing organizations.

Idempotent — only updates rows where data is missing.
Runs AFTER 0014 which adds the level/FK columns.
