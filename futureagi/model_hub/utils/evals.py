Descriptions for Evaluation Metrics
Conversation Evaluations

Conversation Coherence
Measures how well a conversation maintains logical flow, contextual relevance, and thematic consistency throughout the exchange. Evaluates if responses build upon previous messages appropriately and if the dialogue progresses naturally without abrupt topic shifts or contextual gaps.
Conversation Resolution
Assesses whether a multi-participant conversation (requiring at least two users) reaches a satisfactory conclusion where the primary questions or issues are addressed, action items are clarified, or a clear endpoint is established. Evaluates completeness and closure from all participants' perspectives.

Deterministic & Technical Evaluations

Deterministic Evals
Examines whether an AI system produces consistent, reproducible outputs when given identical inputs under the same conditions across multiple modalities (text, images, audio, etc.). Useful for testing system reliability and identifying randomness in generation processes.
Content Moderation
Leverages OpenAI's content moderation system to analyze text for potentially harmful, inappropriate, or prohibited content across categories including hate speech, violence, sexual content, self-harm, and harassment, providing safety scores and category-specific assessments.

Hallucination & Context Evaluations

Context Adherence
Quantifies how faithfully responses stay within the boundaries of provided context without introducing unsubstantiated information. Evaluates if all claims, statements, and information in the response can be directly traced back to the source materials.
Prompt Perplexity
Calculates the model's statistical confidence when generating responses to given prompts. Lower perplexity indicates higher confidence and likely better understanding of the prompt, while higher values may signal confusion or difficulty interpreting the input. Helps identify prompts that may lead to uncertain or inconsistent responses.
Context Relevance
Evaluates how well-matched retrieved context is to the original query in retrieval-augmented systems. Assesses semantic alignment, topical relevance, and whether the context contains the information necessary to formulate a comprehensive response to the query.
Completeness
Measures whether a response addresses all aspects, requirements, and nuances of the original query without omitting critical information. Identifies partial answers, overlooked questions, or instances where the response fails to fully satisfy the user's informational needs.

RAG System Evaluations

Chunk Attribution
Traces which specific parts of the provided context chunks are referenced, paraphrased, or utilized in generating the final response. Creates a mapping between response elements and their source materials to ensure proper attribution.
Chunk Utilization
Assesses the efficiency and effectiveness with which context chunks are incorporated into responses. Measures whether important information is properly weighted, irrelevant information is appropriately filtered, and if the synthesis of multiple chunks is handled coherently.
Context Similarity
Computes semantic and lexical similarity between provided context and expected/ideal context for a query. Helps identify gaps, misalignments, or differences in information quality between what was retrieved and what should have been retrieved.
